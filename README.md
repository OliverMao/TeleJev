# TeleJev (formerly OpenJev)

**Semantic ifs from open models, on a 3090 at home.**

*Independent project; not affiliated with Jev or TypeSafe.*

Most agent decisions are small: *route this*, *retry that*, *does the evidence support X?* A chat model can answer them, but it spends time generating text that software immediately parses back into an `if` statement.

This baseline reads typed option probabilities directly from a model on a single CUDA GPU. No answer sentence, JSON repair, or decoding loop.

## Quick start

Python 3.10+, CUDA, and a GPU that can hold a 4B BF16 model. Install the
runtime dependencies only; the package does not need to be installed:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
export HF_HOME=/path/to/large-drive/huggingface
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the scorer directly from the checkout:

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python run.py \
  --mode direct \
  --model Qwen/Qwen3.5-4B \
  --input decisions.jsonl \
  --output results.jsonl
```

Each result contains typed option scores, timing, and a prompt hash.

Modes:

- `--mode direct` — one forward pass per row, reading declared option logits.
- `--mode serial` — reuse a shared prefix across rows.
- `--mode shared` — prefill an identical state once, then branch across criteria in parallel.

Only one CUDA GPU may be visible to the process; use `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to select it.

## Input

```json
{
  "id": "route-1",
  "state": "Customer cannot access an account after a password reset.",
  "question": "Which queue should handle this request?",
  "options": [
    {"id": "access", "description": "Account access support."},
    {"id": "billing", "description": "Billing support."}
  ]
}
```

Returned probabilities are conditional on the supplied options. Calibrate and validate them on the workload where they will make decisions. `state` may also be a nonempty JSON object or array.
